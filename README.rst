====================================================

(insert shields here)

-------------

**FlItHiC** - (short description)

FlItHiC is a tool that aims to be (more)

The problems FlItHic seeks to solve are:

- Allow for ``nan`` in data to be clustered.
- Allow many Estimators from Scikit-Learn to be used to cluster.
- (more)

Features
--------

- Deals with ``nan`` s in the data.
- Flexible classifier passing. Accepts many Estimators from Scikit-Learn.
- Should behave well with ``scipy.cluster.hierarchy``.

Depends
-------

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Scikit-Learn
