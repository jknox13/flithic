Source code from `scipy.spatial.distance` was originally copied, and then
modified so that the distance algorithms accept `nan`s. The relevant Scipy
license (BSD3) has been included (see LICENSE.txt in ``flithic.distance``).

Using this subpackage requires an explicit import. ie ``import flithic.distance``.
